# Lab 3: BRATS and multimodal MRI

This lab will introduce multiparametric / multspectral MRI, the concepts of noise and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). It will also introduce **supervised learning** (tissue clasification) of the head based on four-channel MRI recordings and manual delination of six different tissue types (or labels: AIR, GM, WM, CSF, MUS. FAT), using K-nearest neighorhood (KNN) clasification in 4D feature space. It will further introduce a multimodal dataset from the BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) challenge and introduce **unsupervised learning** (K-means clustering) of these data using tool from `scikit-learn`.

## Your turn! 

The notebooks have several excerices and suggestions for experiments with the models and their (hyper)parameters.
