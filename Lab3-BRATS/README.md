# Lab 3: BRATS and multimodal MRI

This lab will introduce multiparametric / multspectral MRI, the concepts of noise and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). It will also introduce supervised tissue clasification of the head based on four-channel MRI recordings and manual delination of six different tissue types (labels), using K-nearest neighorhood (KNN) clasification in 4D feature space.
