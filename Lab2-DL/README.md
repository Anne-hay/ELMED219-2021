# Lab 2: deep learning

This lab and the accompanying lecture gave answers to the questions "What is deep learning?", "What makes it different from other kinds of machine learning?", and "How do you _do_ deep learning?".

## Jupyter notebooks

* The notebook [ELMED219-Lab2-CV-Example-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb](./ELMED219-Lab2-CV-Example-MedNIST-using-PyTorch.ipynb) went through a detailed example of deep learning using PyTorch. 
* The notebook [ELMED219-Lab2-CV-Example-MedNIST-using-fastai.ipynb](./ELMED219-Lab2-CV-CV-Example-MedNIST-using-fastai.ipynb) covered some closer to state-of-the-art methods and tools from deep learning. 

## Your turn! 

It is possible to play around with the PyTorch notebook on your own, as it isn't that hard to install the necessary libraries on your computer (in fact, the libraries are installed by running through the notebook). The second notebook is a little more tricky, and you may want to just read through it.
