## Jupyter notebooks

* The notebook [ELMED219-Lab0-simple_examples.ipynb](./ELMED219-Lab0-simple_examples.ipynb) uses machine learning to construct predictive models based on some simple data sets. The goal is to provide a hands-on introduction to some basic ingredients and techniques in machine learning.

## Your turn! 

Spend some time playing around with the provided examples. You'll find some questions for you to investigate in the notebook. If you're already familiar with machine learning you can try your hand at more advanced examples, or, even better, help out other less experienced team members.
