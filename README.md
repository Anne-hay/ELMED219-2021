## ELMED219-2021 (*work in progress*)
# Artificial intelligence and computational medicine

(MittUiB: [ELMED219 21V](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/27607))

The [course](https://www.uib.no/en/course/ELMED219) belongs to the [Department of Biomedicine](https://www.uib.no/biomedisin) and is associated with the [Department of Computer science, Electrical engineering and Mathematical sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/about/management/faculty-of-engineering-and-science/department-of-computer-science-electrical-engineering-and-mathematical-sciences-ny-side), Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, and [Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Center](https://mmiv.no/).

During the course you will gain insight into computationally oriented thinking, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and an understanding of the pros and cons of AI in the medicine of the future. A guided tour is given through some biomedical and clinical applications of mathematical and statistical modeling techniques, as well as principles for selected sensors and measuring instruments in research and clinical practice.


We meet concepts such as **big data**, **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence (AI)**, with examples from personalized and predictive medicine. You will use methods and tools from numerical programming, data analysis and "scientific computing" for medical applications, and learn about the importance of **open science**, **data sharing**, and **reproducible research**.

You will find more (static) information about the course at [MittUiB](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/27607)

# *Prepare you and your computer for computational analysis*
If you are used to work with computer installations and github you can go directly to the material at github and use the guide for setting up your computer and perform notebook exercises.

- **Python course material** at https://github.com/MMIV-ML/ELMED219-2021  – follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready

- **Browser** display and functionality might differ between browsers - we recommend using Mozilla [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) on all platforms

- **Jupyter notebooks** are used throughout the course being a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk and https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks).

-  **Test your environment** [Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Nibabel, Biopython and more]: run through this notebook [`notebooks/0.0-test.ipynb`](notebooks/0.0-test.ipynb) to check that your environment is OK

- Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you edit them*. You can adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`. Remember also to start a new session with a `**git pull**` (things can have changed)

# *Prepare you and your computer for the group-wise project*

### "Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma"

(see also [here](./project/prj-descr.md))


#### *Orient yourself in the material for the group project and how to use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) for writing your report*
_Note: Details will be modified and added before the course start_

- **Project description** (“_Precision medicine and quantitative imaging in glioblastoma_“) at [`prj-descr.md`](project/prj-descr.md)

- **LaTeX template for the report** illustrated with a group project report from the 2019 Summer School at Seili for which *Prostate Cancer* was the topic (see this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/xwjxwcnpzhqv)). We will be using the [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) online, collaborative LaTeX editor (for more information on LaTeX, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and [here](https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-4/senthil/senthil.pdf) and [here](https://mildopinions.wordpress.com/2008/07/07/why-i-use-latex-in-biology), and for LeTeX templates, see e.g. [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-molecular-systems-biology/kyxgttpbzhht) and [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/academic-journal))


Also, for those of you that have limited knowledge about biology and pathology of brain or want to refresh their knowledge, we recommend the free Coursera course https://www.coursera.org/learn/neurobiology, especially the lecture on [brain tumors](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/neurobiology/brain-tumors-fUcn4).

*Excerpt*: Considering the value of big data and the potential of publicly available datasets for increased reproducibility of scientific findings, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created TCGA ([cancergenome.nih.gov](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)) and [TCIA](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7) (www.cancerimagingarchive.net). TCGA is a multi-institutional comprehensive collection of various molecularly characterized tumor types, and its data are available in NCI’s Genomic Data Commons portal ([gdc-portal.nci.nih.gov](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov)). Building upon NIH’s investment in TCGA, the NCI’s Cancer Imaging Program approached sites that contributed tissue samples, to obtain corresponding de-identified routine clinically-acquired radiological data and store them in TCIA. These repositories make available multi-institutional, high-dimensional, multi-parametric data of cancer patients, allowing for radiogenomic analysis.

Task mapping predictions could give neurosurgeons the ability to visualize eloquent areas and avoid potential surgically induced deficits, even without collecting any fMRI data. Our future efforts will focus on using CNNs to provide enhanced mapping accuracy and validating the use of structural imaging to predict task activation maps in clinical populations, such as brain tumor patients._"
